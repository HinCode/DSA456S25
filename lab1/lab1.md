# What did you like/not like about Python?

I like python because it syntax was more like English (human language). We use to code C++ which is more a lower leve language (i hate that).
And it pretty straight forward. Such as printout something is just print("helloworld!") not std::cout << ..........

# Was there anything that behaved differently than you expected in Python ?

There were no pointers in Pyhton, which is great!

# Based on what you wrote in your lab, write something about the similarities and differences between Python with C/C++ and how that affects how you write your program.

They all have functions, differnt loops, conditional stuff, but phthon write it in a easier way. The difference is C++ have more control in resourse and performance. In other hand, python is easier 
for human to read but runs much slower. Thats why majority of the video games were written in C++ not python. Because if AAA games were written in python, it must run very slow.
